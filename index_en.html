<h2 id="what-is-cdm-economy-">What is CDM Economy?</h2>
<p>It is similar to black market economy but the opposite.</p>
<p>In a black market economy, you have the advertised price (cheaper but not available) and the black market price (more expensive but available).</p>
<p>Likewise, in the CDM economy, you have the more expensive price for the military and their assosciates (personnel, organisation or businesses), and the CDM discount for CDM participants and people that we deem fit.</p>
